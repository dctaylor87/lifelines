LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.1.1
https://lifelines.github.io/lifelines/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a brief description of the directory layout.

Source Code Directories
-----------------------

./build/

    Scripts used to set up the development environment and to build and
    package LifeLines.

./build/autotools

    Some of the scripts needed for autotools based development
    README.DEVELOPERS has some information about autotools

./build/gettext

    m4 macro files needed by gettext (the GNU internationalization package)

./build/msvc6

    Project files for Miscrosoft Visual C++ 6

./build/rpm

    spec file used to create rpm (source & binary) distributions
    (rpm is RedHat package distribution format)

./po/

    Translations (gettext message catalogs).

./src/arch/

    Library of replacement functions missing on some platforms.

./src/arch/mswin

	Microsoft Windows specific source code

./src/btree/

    btree (database) implementation, with access functions.
    Used by the rest of lifelines to access the binary database.

./src/gedlib/

    Implementation of the INDISEQ type.
    Implementation of NAME & REFN records.
    Node functions (extracting from & sending to db, and some top-level
     node conversions, eg indi_to_event).
    messages (attempt to put together all strings for hopeful localization).
    miscellaneous other stuff (including initialization code & options).

./src/hdrs/

    Header files.
    screen.h is curses-specific, and will probably be moved eventually.

./src/hdrs/mswin/

    Headers for Microsoft Windows specific code.

./src/interp/

    Report generator program interpreter.

./src/liflines/

    The frontend logic and GUI code of the LifeLines application.
    Code to implement import & export, editing, & merging records.
    The curses interface is somewhat but not entirely separated 
    from the application.
    Curses specific:
      browse.c lbrowse.c loadsave.c main.c menuitem.c pedigree.c screen.c, show.c tandem.c
    (Although browse, lbrowse, & menuitem embody the main command handling, and will have to
    be duplicated in other versions, unlesss they can be reused ?)

./src/stdlib/

    Common data types & functions used by other LifeLines modules,
    including:
      lists (in double.c), tables, sequences, string stuff
    These are all independent of LifeLines or GEDCOM.

./src/tools/

    btedit - edit the binary records in the btree (database) itself
    dbverify - check a database for errors

./ui/ (IN THE FUTURE)

    Will contain UI-specific code for obtaining input and displaying
    output


Non-Source Code Directories
---------------------------

./docs/

    Documentation in various formats, including old quickref, and 
    the new users guide and report manual (and developers guide).

./reports/

    Lifelines language reports (*.ll)

./tt/

   Translation tables, for character set conversions for users
   without iconv, or for custom conversions.
